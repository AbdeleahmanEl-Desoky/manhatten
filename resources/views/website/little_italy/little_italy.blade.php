                            This lively neighborhood, which is sandwiched between SoHo and Chinatown, attracted Italian immigrants looking for a sense of belonging and familiarity in their new city.<br>
                            <br>
                            Little Italy first appeared in the region during the middle of the nineteenth century, when Italian immigrants started to settle there.<br>
                            They initially gathered at Mulberry Bend, which would eventually become Mulberry Street.<br>
                            Little Italy extended southward as the Italian population increased, and Mulberry Street became its major thoroughfare.

                        Little Italy saw considerable alterations in the middle of the 20th century.<br>
                        Many Italian Americans relocated to other areas of the city as they increasingly integrated into American society, leaving a smaller number behind.<br>
                        The neighborhood's scenery was also modified by urban development initiatives, such as the construction of the neighboring housing project known as the "Mulberry-Baxter Redevelopment.<br>
