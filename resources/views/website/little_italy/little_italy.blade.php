                            Little Italy, Manhattan New York City, the attractive and active history of Little Italy in Manhattan, New York City, dates to the 19th century.<br>
                            This lively neighborhood, which is sandwiched between SoHo and Chinatown, attracted Italian immigrants looking for a sense of belonging and familiarity in their new city.<br>
                            <br>
                            Little Italy first appeared in the region during the middle of the nineteenth century, when Italian immigrants started to settle there.<br>
                            They initially gathered at Mulberry Bend, which would eventually become Mulberry Street.<br>
                            Little Italy extended southward as the Italian population increased, and Mulberry Street became its major thoroughfare.

                        Little Italy was most prosperous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br>
                        A bustling and energetic community was spawned by the inflow of Italian immigrants.<br>
                        Italian accents could be heard everywhere, and the scent of delectable Italian food filled the streets.<br>
                        Italian customs were preserved, and the neighborhood was supported in large part by social organizations, mutual help organizations, and churches.<br>
                        <br>
                        Little Italy saw considerable alterations in the middle of the 20th century.<br>
                        Many Italian Americans relocated to other areas of the city as they increasingly integrated into American society, leaving a smaller number behind.<br>
                        The neighborhood's scenery was also modified by urban development initiatives, such as the construction of the neighboring housing project known as the "Mulberry-Baxter Redevelopment.<br>
                        <br>
                        Little Italy still perfectly encapsulates Italian tradition and culture despite these changes.<br>

                        The neighborhood's tenacious character is demonstrated by the annual Feast of San Gennaro Street festival, which is held every September.<br>
                        Parades, live music, activities, and, of course, an abundance of delectable Italian cuisine are all part of this celebratory celebration.<br>
                        <br>
