                        It is a wonderful location for unwinding, taking in the scenery, and taking in the noises of the city.<br>

                        Little Island, New York City Park is 2.4 acre (0.97 hectares) in New York City.<br>
                        Situated on the Hudson River, this park is a unique public space created by Heatherwick Studio, Thomas Heatherwick's design firm.<br>
                        The park's 132 pot-shaped "tulips"—which are hung above the water—are held up by 280 concrete pilings that reach down into the riverbed.<br>
                        The pots' tops are somewhere from 4.6 and 18.9 meters (15 to 62 feet) above the mean waterline.

                                A spectacular illustration of what can be accomplished when art, nature, and design join is this floating park, which debuted in May 2021.<br>
                                On what was formerly a pier in the Hudson River, Little Island is situated.<br>
                                The Lenape tribe once hunted and fished at the location.<br>
                                The city of New York started making plans to revitalize the Hudson River waterfront in the early 2000s.<br>
                                <br>
                                Thomas Heatherwick, a British engineer known for his innovative, cutting-edge, and unusual designs, created the Little Island.<br>
                                By constructing platforms with varying heights that are connected to one another, engineer Thomas hoped to create an island that resembled a floating garden.<br>
                                Additionally, there should be vegetation on the island, including trees, plants, bushes, and flowers.<br>
                                There are around 350 different species of trees, shrubs, and plants on this island.<br>
                                <br>
                                It was carefully picked to be able to resist and endure the Hudson River shoreline.<br>
                                On this island, comfort may be found through the thoughtful construction of corridors, roadways, and rest areas.<br>
                                Little Island, New York City has evolved into a haven of reflection and hope for New Yorkers.<br>

                        Why is it called Little Island?

                        It is called so because it is designed in a small, island-like design.<br>
                        It's built on a floating structure above the water, featuring beautiful hills, pathways, and performance space.<br>
                        The name "Little Island" highlights its relatively small size compared to the larger surrounding islands like Manhattan, Staten Island, and Long Island.
