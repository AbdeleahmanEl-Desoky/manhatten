                        One of the most recognizable bridges in the world and a famous landmark in Manhattan, New York City
                        is Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Nea York City<br>
                        John Augustus Roebling came up with the concept in the late 1860s, and it was finished in 1883.<br>
                        The bridge has both vertical and diagonal suspender cables, making it a hybrid cable-stayed and
                        suspension bridge.<br>
                        <br>
                        Neo-Gothic stone towers with distinctive pointed arches make up this structure.<br>
                        <br>
                        For its time, Brooklyn Bridge's design was ground-breaking. It was the first suspension bridge made
                        of steel wires, and the wires were woven using a novel technique.
                        <br>
                        Significantly more potent. Due to this, the bridge's main span was able to be longer than any other
                        bridge in the world at the time.<br>
                        <br>
                        One distinguishing aspect of the Brooklyn Bridge's design is its Gothic towers. They soar 138 feet
                        above the lake and are constructed of limestone, granite, and cement.<br>
                        The towers contribute to supporting the weight of the bridge in addition to serving as aesthetic
                        elements.<br>
                        <br>
                        A significant innovation in the Brooklyn Bridge's design was the use of steel cables. Iron, which
                        was the material used in most bridges at the time, is significantly weaker than steel.<br>
                        This allowed the Brooklyn Bridge's main span to be extended, and it also greatly increased the
                        bridge's durability.

                        Did you know that on May 24, 1883, the bridge was formally opened to the public? With a length of
                        1,595 feet, it was the world's longest suspension bridge at the time.<br>
                        It retained this record for more than 20 years before the Williamsburg Bridge was finished.

                        Brooklyn bridge, Manhattan New York City, was created by German immigrant John Augustus Roebling,
                        which is another intriguing tidbit.<br>
                        Sadly, Roebling passed away before the bridge's construction started, and his son, Washington
                        Roebling, took over as the principal engineer.<br>
                        Decompression sickness, popularly known as the bends, was one of several difficulties Washington
                        Roebling experienced that left him paralyzed to some extent.<br>
                        Despite these challenges, he carried on supervising the building from his flat with a view of the
                        area.
